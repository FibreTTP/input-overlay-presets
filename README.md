## Usage

After installing [input-overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Installation), extract these presets somewhere (ideally next to the default presets) and select them in OBS as you would the default presets.

Ensure you have read how [to enable](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Input-History) input-history, and how to [set it up](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/tree/master/presets/input-history-windows).
