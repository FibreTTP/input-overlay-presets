My custom presets for [input-overlay](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay).

---

## Installation

* Install input-overlay. >[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Installation)<
* Go to this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/FibreTTP/input-overlay-presets/releases) page, and download the latest input-overlay-presets-v\*.\*.\*.zip file.
* Extract the .zip file somewhere (ideally next to the original presets).

## Usage

Select the image and config files in OBS as you would with the [default presets](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Usage).

### input-history

Ensure you have read how [to enable](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/wiki/Input-History) input-history, and how to [set it up](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/tree/master/presets/input-history-windows).

Note that there is [an issue](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay/issues/230) with the WebSocket inplementation that causes a crash on certain OBS events. It is fixed in code, but has not been released yet (as of 5.0.0).
